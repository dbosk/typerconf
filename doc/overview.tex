\section{Overview}\label{Overview}

We provide a module, \texttt{typerconf}, that can read, modify and write config 
files.
It's designed to easily provide a config to a program.
It also provides a \texttt{config} command to a CLI written using Typer.

This module was originally developed as a part of the \texttt{nytid} package 
(the \texttt{nytid.cli.config} module), to provide a config management similar 
to that of Git.
Due to its usefulness, it has now been broken out into its own package.
